Double beta decay ($\beta\beta$) is a very rare nuclear transition in which a nucleus with $Z$ protons decays into a nucleus with $Z + 2$ protons and the same mass number $A$. The decay can occur only if the initial nucleus is less bound than the final nucleus, and the transition to the $Z+1$ state is forbidden or highly suppressed. There are 35 naturally-occurring isotopes that can undergo $\beta\beta$. Two decay modes are usually considered: (i) the standard two-neutrino mode ($\beta\beta2\nu$), consisting of two simultaneous beta decays, $(Z,A) \rightarrow (Z + 2,A) + 2 e^- +2\overline{\nu}$, which has been observed in several isotopes with typical half-lives in the range of $10^{18}$--$10^{21}$ years; and (ii) the neutrinoless mode (\bbonu), $(Z,A) \rightarrow (Z +2, A) + 2 e^-$, a hypothetical rare decay, which violates lepton-number conservation, and is, therefore, forbidden in the Standard Model.

The \bbonu\ process cannot occur unless neutrinos are Majorana particles. If $\nu$ is a field describing a neutrino, stating that the neutrino is a Majorana particle is equivalent to saying that the charge-conjugated field ---\thinspace that is, a field with all charges reversed\thinspace--- also describes the same particle: $\nu\equiv\nu^c$. If such Majorana condition is not fulfilled, we speak instead of Dirac neutrinos. 

The theoretical implications of experimentally establishing \bbonu\ would, therefore, be profound. In a broad sense, Majorana neutrinos would constitute a new form of matter, given that no Majorana elementary fermions have been observed so far\footnote{Majorana-like collective excitations have instead been observed in certain superconducting materials.}. Also, \bbonu\ observation would prove that total lepton number is not conserved in physical phenomena, a fact that could be linked to the cosmic asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Finally, Majorana neutrinos would mean that a new physics scale must exist and is accessible in an indirect way through neutrino masses. 

In addition to theoretical prejudice in favor of Majorana neutrinos, there are other reasons to hope that experimental observation of \bbonu\ is at hand. Neutrinos are now known to be massive particles thanks to neutrino oscillation experiments. If \bbonu\ is mediated by the standard light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, a non-zero neutrino mass would almost certainly translate into a non-zero \bbonu\ rate. While neutrino oscillation phenomenology is not enough \emph{per se} to provide a firm prediction for what such a rate should be, it does give us hope that a sufficiently fast one to be observable may be realized in nature. 

The importance of massive Majorana neutrinos has triggered a new generation of $\bbonu$~experiments spanning several isotopes and a rich selection of experimental techniques. Five of them have published limits\footnote{Unless otherwise stated, all limits in this review are at 90\% CL.} on the half-life of the \bbonu\ process ($T^{0\nu}_{1/2}$) that exceed $10^{25}$ years, increasing the sensitivity of previous  experiments by at least an order of magnitude. GERDA\footnote{\url{https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/gerda/}} and MAJORANA\footnote{\url{https://sanfordlab.org/experiment/majorana-demonstrator}} (target isotope \Ge{76}) find \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 1.8 \times 10^{26}$} years \cite{GERDA:2020xhi} and \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 8.3 \times 10^{25}$} years \cite{Majorana:2022udl}, respectively; CUORE\footnote{\url{https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/en}} (target isotope \Te{130}) obtains \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 2.2 \times 10^{25}$} years \cite{CUORE:2021mvw}; EXO-200\footnote{\url{https://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/exo/}} and KamLAND-Zen\footnote{\url{https://www.ipmu.jp/en/research-activities/research-program/kamland}} (target isotope \Xe{136}) set limits of \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 3.5 \times 10^{25}$} years \cite{EXO-200:2019rkq} and \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 2.3 \times 10^{26}$} years \cite{KamLAND-Zen:2022tow}, respectively. 
 
In addition, the CUPID demonstrators proved the feasibility of scintillating bolometer detectors, which are currently envisioned as the successors of conventional bolometers (such as those used by CUORE) and have set limits to the \bbonu\ process for two relevant isotopes. For \Mo{100}, CUPID-Mo sets a limit of \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 1.8 \times 10^{24}$} years \cite{Augier:2022znx} and for \Se{82}, CUPID-0 finds \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 4.6 \times 10^{24}$} years \cite{CUPID:2022puj}. 

Also, during the last five years, the NEXT experiment\footnote{\url{https://next.ific.uv.es/next/}} has successfully demonstrated, through the operation of the NEXT-White demonstrator, the suitability of the technology based on electroluminescent high pressure xenon chambers (HPXeEL). In spite of the small mass of NEXT-White (3.5 kg of \Xe{136} in the fiducial region), the detector has carried out a search for \bbonu\ events, setting a limit of \mbox{$T^{0\nu}_{1/2} > 1.3 \times 10^{24}$} years  \cite{NEXT:2023daz}. NEXT-100, currently being commissioned at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC), deploys a much larger mass of \Xe{136} and will reach a sensitivity comparable to that of EXO-200.

It is important to remark that, in spite of the much increased sensitivity of the experiments discussed above, the resulting limits on the effective neutrino mass (see section \ref{sec:bb0nu} for a detailed discussion) are relatively modest. For example, the limit set by GERDA, translates into $m_{\beta\beta} <$~79--180~meV. The push to explore smaller neutrino masses has resulted in a major experimental effort to build detectors which will deploy, typically, one order of magnitude larger masses than their previous incarnations, while, at the same time, reducing the background in the region of interest (ROI) by the same amount. In the process, GERDA and MAJORANA have joined into a single collaboration, LEGEND\footnote{\url{https://legend-exp.org}}, whose first phase, LEGEND-200, has already started data taking. CUORE has mutated into CUPID\footnote{\url{https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/pages/cupid-en}}, EXO-200 has inspired the nEXO\footnote{\url{https://nexo.llnl.gov}} proposal, which aims to scale up the LXe technology from about 200~kg to 5~tons, and the NEXT collaboration intends to follow up NEXT-100 with NEXT-HD, a ton-scale HPXeEL, and is actively researching the possibility to build a detector (dubbed NEXT-BOLD) capable of detecting the single Ba$^{2+}$ ion emitted in the decay as a mean to drastically suppress backgrounds. Also, the large scintillating calorimeters, KamLAND-Zen and SNO+\footnote{\url{https://snoplus.phy.queensu.ca}} are proposing upgrades which are both larger and able to control the background better. In addition, a host of R\&D proposals are being developed (see, for example, \cite{Dell_Oro_2016} and references therein).

Here, we review the state-of-the-art of this exciting and rapidly changing field. 
The organization of the paper is as follows. The introductory material is covered in sections~\ref{sec:massivenu} and \ref{sec:bb0nu}. The key particle physics concepts involving massive Majorana neutrinos and neutrinoless double beta decay are laid out here. The current experimental knowledge on neutrino masses, lepton number violating processes in general, and \bbonu\ in particular, is also described in sections~\ref{sec:massivenu} and \ref{sec:bb0nu}. Sections \ref{sec:nme}, \ref{sec:ingredients} and \ref{sec:experiments} cover more advanced topics. The theoretical aspects of the nuclear physics of \bbonu\ are discussed in section~\ref{sec:nme}. Sections \ref{sec:ingredients} and \ref{sec:experiments} deal with experimental aspects of \bbonu, and can be read without knowledge of section~\ref{sec:nme}. An attempt at a pedagogical discussion of experimental ingredients affecting \bbonu\ searches is made in section~\ref{sec:ingredients}. Section \ref{sec:experiments} adds a description of selected past, present and future experiments.
