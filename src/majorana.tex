The MAJORANA Collaboration is following a more classic approach than GERDA in the design of a germanium-based experiment \cite{Majorana:2011rit}. The Ge detectors will be mounted in a string-like arrangement in ultra-pure vacuum cryostat made from radiopure copper. The cryostat will be surrounded by a passive shielding of Cu and Pb, and an active muon veto.

The Collaboration is building a demonstrator module, to be placed at the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) in the United States, with about 20 kg of natural BEGe detectors. The goal is to demonstrate a background rate of about 4 counts per tonne and per year in the 4-keV wide region of interest \cite{Majorana:2011vap}. The demonstrator is expected to operate with enriched detectors in 2013.
