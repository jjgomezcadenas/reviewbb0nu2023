\abstract{Neutrinos could be the only elementary particles identical to their own antiparticles, as postulated by Ettore Majorana almost a century ago. Neutrino oscillation experiments have established that neutrinos are indeed massive, and rekindled the question of the origin of their masses. Consequently, the last two decades have witnessed the development of a vigorous program of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, spanning several isotopes and developing different strategies to handle the backgrounds to a putative signal. In addition, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements, thus reducing a substantial part of the theoretical uncertainties affecting the particle physics interpretation of this process. On the other hand, the negative results by several experiments, combined with the hint that neutrino mass ordering could be normal, may imply very light neutrino masses and thus very long lifetimes for the neutrinoless double beta decay process. In this report, we review the main aspects of such process, the recent progress on theoretical ideas and the experimental state-of-the-art. We then consider the experimental challenges to be addressed in order to increase the sensitivity to detect the process in the likely case that lifetimes are much longer than currently explored and discuss a selection of the most promising experimental efforts.
